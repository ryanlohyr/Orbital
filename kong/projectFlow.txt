flow of project (admin)

1. create a service for the user to connect to 

curl -i -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
  --data name=example_service \
  --data url='http://mockbin.org'

^^This request instructs Kong Gateway 
to create a new service mapped to the upstream URL http://mockbin.org.

2. Configure a new route on the /mock path to direct traffic 
to the example_service service created earlier:
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example_service/routes \
  --data 'paths[]=/mock' \
  --data name=example_route



flow of project (user)
1. Proxy a request through Kong Gateway to the /requests resource:
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/mock/requests
